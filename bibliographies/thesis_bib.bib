	pharmacokinetic data. Traditionally, so-called compartmental
	models have been used to analyze such data. Unfortunately, the
	mean function of such models are sums of exponentials for which
	inference and computation may not be straightforward. We present
	an alternative to these models based on generalized linear
	models, for which desirable statistical properties exist, with a
	logarithmic link and gamma distribution. The latter has a
	constant coefficient of variation, which is often appropriate for
	pharmacokinetic data. Inference is convenient from either a
	likelihood or a Bayesian perspective. We consider models for both
	single and multiple individuals, the latter via generalized
	linear mixed models. For single individuals, Bayesian computation
	may be carried out with recourse to simulation. We describe a
	rejection algorithm that, unlike Markov chain Monte Carlo,
	produces independent samples from the posterior and allows
	straightforward calculation of Bayes factors for model
	comparison. We also illustrate how prior distributions may be
	specified in terms of model-free pharmacokinetic parameters of
	interest. The methods are applied to data from 12 individuals
	following administration of the antiasthmatic agent theophylline.",

	abstract = "This review summarises the available data on the population
	pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and use of Maximum A Posteriori
	(MAP) Bayesian estimation to predict tacrolimus exposure and
	subsequent drug dosage requirements in solid organ transplant
	recipients. A literature search was conducted which identified 56
	studies that assessed the population pharmacokinetics of
	tacrolimus based on non-linear mixed effects modelling and 14
	studies that assessed the predictive performance of MAP Bayesian
	estimation of tacrolimus area under the plasma concentration-time
	curve (AUC) from time zero to the end of the dosing interval.
	Studies were most commonly undertaken in adult kidney transplant
	recipients and investigated the immediate-release formulation.
	The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus were described using one- and
	two-compartment disposition models with first-order elimination
	in 61 and 39 \% of population pharmacokinetic studies,
	respectively. Variability in tacrolimus whole blood apparent
	clearance amongst transplant recipients was most commonly related
	to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 genotype (rs776746), patient
	haematocrit, patient weight, post-operative day and hepatic
	function (aspartate aminotransferase). Bias, as calculated using
	estimation of the mean predictive error (MPE) or mean percentage
	predictive error (MPPE) associated with prediction of the
	tacrolimus AUC, ranged from -15 to 9.95 \%. Imprecision, as
	calculated through estimation of the root mean squared error
	(RMSE) or mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), was generally
	much poorer overall, ranging from 0.81 to 40. r values ranged
	from 0.27 to 0.99 \%. Of the Bayesian forecasting strategies that
	used two or more tacrolimus concentrations, 71 \% showed bias of
	10 \% or less; however, only 39 \% showed imprecision of 10 \% or
	less. The combination of sampling times at 0, 1 and 3 h post-dose
	consistently showed bias and imprecision values of less than 15
	\%. No studies to date have examined how closely MAP Bayesian
	dosage predictions of tacrolimus actually achieve target AUC by
	comparing dosage prediction from one occasion with a future
	measured AUC. Further research involving larger prospective
	studies including more diverse transplant groups and the
	extended-release formulation of tacrolimus is needed. Several
	questions require further examination, including the following.
	Do Bayesian forecasting methods currently use the most
	appropriate population pharmacokinetic models and optimal
	sampling times for dosage prediction? Does Bayesian forecasting
	perform well when applied to make dosage predictions on a
	subsequent occasion? How can Bayesian forecasting be simplified
	for use in the clinical setting? And, are patient outcomes
	improved with dosage prediction based on Bayesian forecasting
	compared with trough concentration monitoring?",

	Bayesian estimation for a five-probe phenotyping cocktail",
	author   = "Nguyen, Thu Thuy and B{\'e}nech, Henri and Pruvost, Alain and

	abstract = "PURPOSE: Cocktail approach using a combination of probes to
	phenotype several cytochromes P450 or transporters is of high
	interest in anticipating drug--drug interactions and personalized
	medicine. Its clinical use remains however limited by the
	intensive sampling scheme required to obtain phenotyping indexes
	(PI) which consists in calculating the area under the
	concentration--time curves. We proposed to use maximum a
	posteriori Bayesian estimation (MAPBE) that incorporates
	available information from the whole population to derive PI from
	a few individual observations. The performance of a limited
	sampling strategy (LSS) based on MAPBE was evaluated for a
	five-probe cocktail. METHODS: The studied cocktail included
	midazolam, tolbutamide, caffeine, dextromethorphan, omeprazole
	and their relevant metabolites. Prior information for MAPBE was
	obtained by nonlinear mixed-effect modelling of data from a pilot
	study. Sampling times were chosen based on optimal design theory
	using the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Through a
	simulation study, we investigated the predicted PI in terms of
	bias and imprecision for varying number and timing of samples.
	RESULTS: Some three-point Bayesian designs gave mean prediction
	errors in [−5 \%, 5 \%], root mean square errors below 30 \% for
	all probes, except dextromethorphan whose model should be
	consolidated further with additional data. This approach gave
	overall less outlier predicted values than single-point metrics
	and was more flexible to the timing of the latest sampling.
	CONCLUSIONS: MAPBE is accurate for predicting simultaneously
	several PI while being flexible in terms of integrating clinical
	constraints. Therefore, LSS based on MAPBE could help reduce the
	time of presence in hospital for individuals to be phenotyped.",

	abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Warfarin is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant drug
	used to prevent thromboses that may arise as a consequence of
	orthopedic and vascular surgery or underlying cardiovascular
	disease. Warfarin is associated with a notoriously narrow
	therapeutic window where small variations in dosing may result in
	hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. To ultimately improve
	dosing of warfarin, we evaluated models for stable maintenance
	dose that incorporated both clinical and genetic factors. METHOD:
	A model was constructed by evaluating the contribution to dosing
	variability of the following clinical factors: age, gender, body
	surface area, and presence or absence of prosthetic heart valves
	or diabetes. The model was then sequentially expanded by
	incorporating polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9; vitamin
	K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1); gamma
	carboxylase; factor VII; and apolipoprotein (Apo) E genes.
	RESULTS: Of genetic factors evaluated in the model, CYP2C9 and
	VKORC1 each contributed substantially to dose variability, and
	together with clinical factors explained 56\% of the individual
	variability in stable warfarin dose. In contrast, gamma
	carboxylase, factor VII and Apo E polymorphisms contributed
	little to dose variability. CONCLUSION: The importance of CYP2C9
	and VKORC1 to patient-specific dose of warfarin has been
	confirmed, while polymorphisms of gamma carboxylase, factor VII

	prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary

	50\%. Food does not have a clinically meaningful impact on the
	bioavailability. Apixaban exposure increases dose proportionally

	include C for any LSS, unless it was forced into the model. MAPB
	estimation showed similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: In renal
	transplant patients, sampling in the elimination phase (C)
	accurately predicted Tac QD exposure, contrary to C. The 3-point
	sampling C C and C had the best performance and is also valid
	early post-transplant. These LSS's were similarly predictive with
	MAPB estimation. Dried blood spot could facilitate late sampling

	over-dose in patients at doses lower than 2 mg/kg, and only 50\%

	In this study, we developed a novel population pharmacokinetic
	(PK) model based on a warfarin dose algorithm for Han Chinese
	patients with valve replacement for improving the dose prediction
	accuracy, especially in patients with low doses. The individual
	pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter - apparent clearance of S- and
	R-warfarin (CLs) was obtained after establishing and validating
	the population PK model from 296 recruited patients with valve
	replacement. Then, the individual estimation of CLs, VKORC1
	genotypes, the steady-state international normalized ratio (INR)
	values and age were used to describe the maintenance doses by
	multiple linear regression for 144 steady-state patients. The
	newly established dosing algorithm was then validated in an
	independent group of 42 patients and was compared with other
	dosing algorithms for the accuracy and precision of prediction.
	The final regression model developed was as follows:
	Dose=-0.023$\times$AGE+1.834$\times$VKORC1+0.952$\times$INR+2.156$\times$CLs
	(the target INR value ranges from 1.8 to 2.5). The validation of
	the algorithm in another group of 42 patients showed that the
	individual variation rate (71.6\%) was higher than in the
	gene-guided dosing models. The over-estimation rate in patients
	with low doses (<2 mg/kg) was lower than the other dosing
	methods. This novel dosing algorithm based on a population PK
	model improves the predictive performance of the maintenance dose

	of the most important issues which can be improved using decision
	support systems. In this paper, a new multi-objective feature
	approach has been proposed to support warfarin dose prediction
	decision. Warfarin is an anticoagulant normally used in the
	prevention of the formation of clots. This research was conducted
	on 553 patients during 2013-2015 who were candidates for using
	warfarin and their INR was in the target range. Features
	affecting dose was implemented and evaluated, which were clinical
	and genetic characteristics extracted, and new methods of feature
	selection based on multi-objective optimization methods such as
	the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and
	Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) along with
	the evaluation of artificial neural networks were used.
	Multi-objective optimization methods have more accuracy and
	performance compared to the classic methods of feature selection.
	Furthermore, multi-objective particle swarm optimization
	algorithm has higher precision than Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
	Algorithm-II. With a choice of seven features Mean Square Error
