	abstract = {A dynamic treatment regime consists of a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of intervention, that dictate how to individualize treatments to patients, based on evolving treatment and covariate history. These regimes are particularly useful for managing chronic disorders and fit well into the larger paradigm of personalized medicine. They provide one way to operationalize a clinical decision support system. Statistics plays a key role in the construction of evidence-based dynamic treatment regimes—informing the best study design as well as efficient estimation and valid inference. Owing to the many novel methodological challenges this area offers, it has been growing in popularity among statisticians in recent years. In this article, we review the key developments in this exciting field of research. In particular, we discuss the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs, estimation techniques like Q-learning and marginal structural models, and several inference techniques designed to address the associated nonstandard asymptotics. We reference software whenever available. We also outline some important future directions.},

	abstract = {Abstract This review summarises the available data on the population pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and use ofMaximum A Posteriori(MAP) Bayesian estimation to predict tacrolimus exposure and subsequent drug dosage requirements in solid organ transplant recipients. A literature search was conducted which identified 56 studies that assessed the population pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus based on non-linear mixed effects modelling and 14 studies that assessed the predictive performance of MAP Bayesian estimation of tacrolimus area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to the end of the dosing interval. Studies were most commonly undertaken in adult kidney transplant recipients and investigated the immediate-release formulation. The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus were described using one- and two-compartment disposition models with first-order elimination in 61 and 39 \% of population pharmacokinetic studies, respectively. Variability in tacrolimus whole blood apparent clearance amongst transplant recipients was most commonly related to cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A5genotype (rs776746), patient haematocrit, patient weight, post-operative day and hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase). Bias, as calculated using estimation of the mean predictive error (MPE) or mean percentage predictive error (MPPE) associated with prediction of the tacrolimus AUC, ranged from −15 to 9.95 \%. Imprecision, as calculated through estimation of the root mean squared error (RMSE) or mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), was generally much poorer overall, ranging from 0.81 to 40.r2values ranged from 0.27 to 0.99 \%. Of the Bayesian forecasting strategies that used two or more tacrolimus concentrations, 71 \% showed bias of 10 \% or less; however, only 39 \% showed imprecision of 10 \% or less. The combination of sampling times at 0, 1 and 3 h post-dose consistently showed bias and imprecision values of less than 15 \%. No studies to date have examined how closely MAP Bayesian dosage predictions of tacrolimus actually achieve target AUC by comparing dosage prediction from one occasion with a future measured AUC. Further research involving larger prospective studies including more diverse transplant groups and the extended-release formulation of tacrolimus is needed. Several questions require further examination, including the following. Do Bayesian forecasting methods currently use the most appropriate population pharmacokinetic models and optimal sampling times for dosage prediction? Does Bayesian forecasting perform well when applied to make dosage predictions on a subsequent occasion? How can Bayesian forecasting be simplified for use in the clinical setting? And, are patient outcomes improved with dosage prediction based on Bayesian forecasting compared with trough concentration monitoring?},

Following the first theoretical work on optimal design for nonlinear mixed-effects models, this research theme has grown rapidly. There are now several different software tools that implement an evaluation of the Fisher information matrix for population PKPD. We compared and evaluated the following five software tools: PFIM, PkStaMp, PopDes, PopED and POPT. The comparisons were performed using two models, a simple-one compartment warfarin PK model and a more complex PKPD model for pegylated interferon, with data on both concentration and response of viral load of hepatitis C virus. The results of the software were compared in terms of the standard error (SE) values of the parameters predicted from the software and the empirical SE values obtained via replicated clinical trial simulation and estimation. For the warfarin PK model and the pegylated interferon PKPD model, all software gave similar results. Interestingly, it was seen, for all software, that the simpler approximation to the Fisher information matrix, using the block diagonal matrix, provided predicted SE values that were closer to the empirical SE values than when the more complicated approximation was used (the full matrix). For most PKPD models, using any of the available software tools will provide meaningful results, avoiding cumbersome simulation and allowing design optimization.},

The relationship between apixaban concentration and anti-FXa activity was described by a linear model with a slope estimate of 0.0159 IU/ng.

This open label, parallel group study investigated effects of extremes of body weight on apixaban pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability. Method Fifty-four healthy subjects were enrolled [18 each into low (≤50 kg), reference (65–85 kg) and high (≥120 kg) body weight groups]. Following administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg apixaban, plasma and urine samples were collected for determination of apixaban pharmacokinetics and anti-factor Xa activity. Adverse events, vital signs and laboratory assessments were monitored. Results Compared with the reference body weight group, low body weight had approximately 27\% [90\% confidence interval (CI): 8–51\%] and 20\% (90\% CI: 11–42\%) higher apixaban maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration–time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0,∞)), respectively, and high body weight had approximately 31\% (90\% CI: 18–41\%) and 23\% (90\% CI: 9–35\%) lower apixaban Cmax and AUC(0,∞), respectively. Apixaban renal clearance was similar across the weight groups. Plasma anti-factor Xa activity showed a direct, linear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, regardless of body weight group. Apixaban was well tolerated in this study. Conclusion The modest change in apixaban exposure is unlikely to require dose adjustment for apixaban based on body weight alone. However, caution is warranted in the presence of additional factors (such as severe renal impairment) that could increase apixaban exposure.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is still the number one cause of death due to an infectious disease. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs are key in the optimization of TB treatment and help to prevent slow response to treatment, acquired drug resistance, and adverse drug effects. The aim of this review was to provide an update on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs and to show how population pharmacokinetics and Bayesian dose adjustment can be used to optimize treatment. We cover aspects on preclinical, clinical, and population pharmacokinetics of different drugs used for drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB. Moreover, we include available data to support therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs and known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets that can be used for optimization of therapy. We have identified a wide range of population pharmacokinetic models for first- and second-line drugs used for TB, which included models built on NONMEM, Pmetrics, ADAPT, MWPharm, Monolix, Phoenix, and NPEM2 software. The first population models were built for isoniazid and rifampicin; however, in recent years, more data have emerged for both new anti-TB drugs, but also for defining targets of older anti-TB drugs. Since the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring for TB over 3 decades ago, further development of therapeutic drug monitoring in TB next steps will again depend on academic and clinical initiatives. We recommend close collaboration between researchers and the World Health Organization to provide important guideline updates regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.},

Its pharmacokinetic profile is known to be affected by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A metabolism, while it is also a substrate of the efflux transporters ATP-binding cassette (ABC)B1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP). In this study, we assessed the impact of interacting medication and pharmacogenetic variation to better explain apixaban concentration differences among 358 Caucasian AF patients. Genotyping (ABCG2, ABCB1, CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3) was performed by TaqMan assays, and apixaban quantified by mass spectrometry. The typical patient was on average 77.2 years old, 85.5 kg, and had a serum creatinine of 103.1 µmol/L. Concomitant amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent and moderate CYP3A/ABCB1 inhibitor, the impaired-function variant ABCG2 c.421C {\textgreater} A, and sex predicted higher apixaban concentrations when controlling for age, weight and serum creatinine (multivariate regression; R2 = 0.34). Our findings suggest that amiodarone and ABCG2 genotype contribute to interpatient apixaban variability beyond known clinical factors.},

	abstract = {Background
	Evidence from clinical trials suggests a differential effect of sex on the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation (AF).
	Methods
	This population-based cohort study examined the independent effect of sex on hemorrhage and ischemic stroke in 23,884 patients (55\% females; age ≥ 66 years) with AF starting apixaban or rivaroxaban treatment in Ontario, Canada. Patients were followed for 90 days after their DOAC prescription. Using female sex as the exposure of interest, differences in baseline characteristics were balanced between sexes using inverse probability weights based on propensity scores. Applying weighted modified Poisson regression, risk ratios (RRs) were estimated for major hemorrhage, ischemic stroke/systemic embolism/transient ischemic attack (hereafter stroke), myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality, with males as a reference.
	Results
	Females were older, had higher predicted stroke risk (based on CHADS2 score), and had fewer comorbidities than did males. Males had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and cancer, and similar predicted bleeding risk (based on HAS-BLED score). After weighting, baseline characteristics were well balanced. The 90-day risks for hemorrhage (RR 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-1.15; P = 0.69) and stroke (RR 1.01; 95\% CI 0.86-1.19; P = 0.94) were similar between sexes, which remained true when assessing each DOAC separately by dosing regimen. Compared to males, females had a lower risk for myocardial infarction (RR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.52-0.84; P = 0.0008), and for all-cause mortality (RR 0.76; 95\% CI 0.67-0.87; P {\textless} 0.0001).
	Conclusions
	Our findings do not suggest an association of sex with the 90-day risk of hemorrhage or ischemic stroke in older AF patients prescribed apixaban or rivaroxaban.
	Résumé
	Contexte
	Les données probantes issues des essais cliniques donnent à penser que l’efficacité et l’innocuité des anticoagulants oraux directs (AOD) utilisés pour la prophylaxie des accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC) dans un contexte de fibrillation auriculaire (FA) varient selon le sexe du patient.
	Méthodologie
	Cette étude de cohorte populationnelle a examiné l’effet indépendant du sexe sur l’hémorragie et l’AVC ischémique chez 23 884 patients (55 \% de femmes; âge ≥ 66 ans) atteints de FA ayant amorcé un traitement par l’apixaban ou le rivaroxaban en Ontario (Canada). Les patients ont été suivis pendant 90 jours après avoir reçu une ordonnance d’AOD. Le sexe féminin constituant l’exposition d’intérêt, les différences quant aux caractéristiques initiales ont été réparties de façon équilibrée entre les sexes au moyen d’une pondération par probabilité inverse reposant sur le score de propension. La régression de Poisson modifiée avec pondération a servi à estimer les rapports de risques (RR) d’hémorragie majeure, d’AVC ischémique/d’embolie systémique/d’accident ischémique transitoire (ci-après AVC), d’infarctus du myocarde et de mortalité toutes causes confondues, les hommes formant la population de référence.
	Résultats
	Les femmes étaient plus âgées, présentaient un risque prévu d’AVC plus élevé (d’après le score CHADS2) et présentaient moins de maladies concomitantes que les hommes. Les hommes présentaient une prévalence plus élevée de coronaropathie, de diabète et de cancer, et un risque prévu d’hémorragie similaire (compte tenu du score HAS-BLED). Après la pondération, la répartition des caractéristiques initiales des patients était bien équilibrée. Le risque d’hémorragie (RR : 0,96; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 \% : 0,80-1,15; P = 0,69) et d’AVC (RR : 1,01; IC à 95 \% : 0,86-1,19; P = 0,94) sur 90 jours était similaire pour les deux sexes, et il en était de même lorsque chaque AOD a été évalué séparément en fonction du schéma posologique. Par rapport aux hommes, les femmes présentaient un risque plus faible d’infarctus du myocarde (RR : 0,66; IC à 95 \% : 0,52-0,84; P = 0,0008) et de mortalité toutes causes confondues (RR : 0,76; IC à 95 \% : 0,67-0,87; P {\textless} 0,0001).
	Conclusions
	Nos résultats ne laissent présumer aucune association entre le sexe et le risque d’hémorragie ou d’AVC ischémique sur une période de 90 jours chez les patients âgés atteints de FA à qui l’apixaban ou le rivaroxaban sont prescrits.},

	abstract = {Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Many studies have shown that it shows high pharmacokinetic interindividual and intraindividual variability (IIV). The risk of hemorrhage is a major concern for patients treated with apixaban to undergo an operation or an invasive procedure. Due to this large pharmacokinetic variability, the current recommendations concerning the optimal duration of apixaban discontinuation before a high-bleeding risk procedure concern the general population and not a specific patient. The aim of this study was (1) to investigate by simulation the distribution of decay time of apixaban concentration and (2) to develop and validate an easy-to-use web tool to estimate the individual decay time of apixaban in a “real-life” situation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to select the relevant pharmacokinetic models for the creation of the web tool. For each model, pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated and the time to reach concentrations below the threshold of 30 ng/ml (T30) was calculated. One of the selected models was chosen to perform a Bayesian estimation and predict the optimal duration of apixaban discontinuation before a high-bleeding risk procedure. All these results were concatenated into the PrevBleed application developed with the R Shiny package.},

	an alternative to these models based on generalized linear

	constant coefficient of variation, which is often appropriate for
	pharmacokinetic data. Inference is convenient from either a
	likelihood or a Bayesian perspective. We consider models for both
	single and multiple individuals, the latter via generalized
	linear mixed models. For single individuals, Bayesian computation
	may be carried out with recourse to simulation. We describe a
	rejection algorithm that, unlike Markov chain Monte Carlo,
	produces independent samples from the posterior and allows
	straightforward calculation of Bayes factors for model
	comparison. We also illustrate how prior distributions may be

	abstract = "PURPOSE: Cocktail approach using a combination of probes to
	phenotype several cytochromes P450 or transporters is of high
	interest in anticipating drug--drug interactions and personalized
	medicine. Its clinical use remains however limited by the
	intensive sampling scheme required to obtain phenotyping indexes
	(PI) which consists in calculating the area under the
	concentration--time curves. We proposed to use maximum a
	posteriori Bayesian estimation (MAPBE) that incorporates
	available information from the whole population to derive PI from
	a few individual observations. The performance of a limited
	sampling strategy (LSS) based on MAPBE was evaluated for a
	five-probe cocktail. METHODS: The studied cocktail included
	midazolam, tolbutamide, caffeine, dextromethorphan, omeprazole
	and their relevant metabolites. Prior information for MAPBE was
	obtained by nonlinear mixed-effect modelling of data from a pilot
	study. Sampling times were chosen based on optimal design theory
	using the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Through a
	simulation study, we investigated the predicted PI in terms of
	bias and imprecision for varying number and timing of samples.
	RESULTS: Some three-point Bayesian designs gave mean prediction
	errors in [−5 \%, 5 \%], root mean square errors below 30 \% for
	all probes, except dextromethorphan whose model should be
	consolidated further with additional data. This approach gave
	overall less outlier predicted values than single-point metrics
	and was more flexible to the timing of the latest sampling.
	CONCLUSIONS: MAPBE is accurate for predicting simultaneously
	several PI while being flexible in terms of integrating clinical
	constraints. Therefore, LSS based on MAPBE could help reduce the
	time of presence in hospital for individuals to be phenotyped.",

	abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Warfarin is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant drug
	used to prevent thromboses that may arise as a consequence of
	orthopedic and vascular surgery or underlying cardiovascular
	disease. Warfarin is associated with a notoriously narrow
	therapeutic window where small variations in dosing may result in
	hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. To ultimately improve
	dosing of warfarin, we evaluated models for stable maintenance
	dose that incorporated both clinical and genetic factors. METHOD:
	A model was constructed by evaluating the contribution to dosing
	variability of the following clinical factors: age, gender, body
	surface area, and presence or absence of prosthetic heart valves
	or diabetes. The model was then sequentially expanded by
	incorporating polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9; vitamin
	K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1); gamma
	carboxylase; factor VII; and apolipoprotein (Apo) E genes.
	RESULTS: Of genetic factors evaluated in the model, CYP2C9 and
	VKORC1 each contributed substantially to dose variability, and
	together with clinical factors explained 56\% of the individual
	variability in stable warfarin dose. In contrast, gamma
	carboxylase, factor VII and Apo E polymorphisms contributed
	little to dose variability. CONCLUSION: The importance of CYP2C9
	and VKORC1 to patient-specific dose of warfarin has been
	confirmed, while polymorphisms of gamma carboxylase, factor VII
	and Apo E genes did not substantially contribute to predictive
	models for stable warfarin dose.",

	abstract = "PURPOSE: Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic window. Measuring
	trough level (C) as surrogate for drug exposure (AUC) in renal
	transplant recipients has limitations. Therefore, limited
	sampling strategies (LSS's) have been developed. For the newer
	modified release, once-daily formulation (Tac QD) LSS's are based
	on either linear regression analysis (LRA) or population
	pharmacokinetics with maximum a posteriori Bayesian (MAPB)
	estimation. The predictive performances of both methods were
	compared, also to LSS's as described in literature. METHODS:
	LSS's (maximally three sampling time points) were developed for
	Tac QD from full 24-h sampling by LRA in 27 Caucasian, stable
	renal transplant recipients. Performance for accuracy (mean
	absolute prediction error < 10\%) and precision (root mean
	squared error < 15\%) was quantified also after MAPB estimation
	in two independent groups (early and late post-transplant, n = 12
	each). RESULTS: LRA determined a single 8 hours post-dose
	measurement (C) to fulfil predefined criteria for accuracy (MAPE
	3.41\%) and precision (RMSE 4.28\%). The best LSS contained C, C
	and C for the stable (MAPE 2.42\%, RMSE 3.1\%) and the early
	post-transplant group (MAPE 2.46\%, RMSE 3.14\%). LRA did not
	include C for any LSS, unless it was forced into the model. MAPB
	estimation showed similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: In renal
	transplant patients, sampling in the elimination phase (C)
	accurately predicted Tac QD exposure, contrary to C. The 3-point
	sampling C C and C had the best performance and is also valid
	early post-transplant. These LSS's were similarly predictive with

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},
