### Motivation

* Different people react differently to the same drug, even if they match on important variables. Patients can have:

  * Heightened response ($\to$ toxicity)
  * Lowered response ($\to$ inefficacy)
 
* Personalized medicine is a response to this variation

### Personalized Medicine

*Personalized Medicine (PM)*: Application of genomic, demographic, and lifestyle factors as predictors of disease risk and individualization of drug therapy [@morse2015personalized].

Morse and Kim identify 4 goals of PM:

  1) Identify drugs for which excess variation in response is key issue to treatment
  2) **Identify factors driving this variation**
  3) **"Right patient, right drug, right amount, right time"**
  4) Aid in prevention of adverse events associated with said drugs


Thesis Goal: Develop methodology \textcolor{uwo-purple}{2) and 3)}.
